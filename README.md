Issues
======

Welcome to the Issue Repo. This is where you report issues that may be occurring on the server or any other Altitude services. **Please read this document before continuing.**

======
###How to report issues

**Before you start**, make sure you have a Github account.

1. Click 'Issues' in the bar on the right.
2. Click 'New Issue'

**NOTE**: Make sure you **search an issue before you report it**, to make sure there are no duplicates. To do this, use the search bar at the top. Do **not** report server-breaking issues here. Instead, report them to `altitudemapdev@googlemail.com`. 

=====
###Please refrain from the following:

1. Reporting issues already made
2. Reporting fake issues
3. Spamming the issue repo
4. Harassing or being rude to other users

You are free to make suggestions.
